\chapter{Toward the next generation of screenings}
\vspace*{-1\baselineskip}

\section{Limits of the Current Screening Methodologies}

As presented in our review of the different screening methodologies in the chapter 1, it is very common to screen for one particular metric whether it is the selectivity or the permselectivity or the capacity depending on the targeted application. Attempts of screening that searches for the most selective materials but combined with a good capacity are more and more common.\autocite{Chung_2019,Zhang_2022,Solanki_2020} If we take the problem of the selectivity screening, many improvements can be made in terms of calculation efficiency, or in terms of correctness of the molecular description. In the previous chapters, I mostly focused on the gain in efficiency by exploring many adsorption energy sampling techniques and by comparing their computational time as well as their accuracy. But I also started to incorporate other properties to the screening procedure by exploring the transport properties for instance. And in an effort to always aim at better efficiency, I explored alternative calculation strategies in addition to the more standard ones. 

To further improve the shortcomings of the current adsorption screening methodologies, we need to explore even more material properties. For example, the rigidity of the structures in most of the screening procedures could sometimes mislead toward materials that appear to have a very high selectivity, whereas the flexible nature of the material tend to lower the calculated selectivity. By taking into account flexibility, one could completely change the rankings found by the screening and hence finding other maybe better materials through this new approach. The other property that could completely change the results obtained by current methodologies is the polarization. For adsorbates like xenon and krypton, the difference in polarizability is in fact at the origin of the separability of these gas using an adsorbent-material. A better description of this particular property can in fact completely change the results of the screening. If we look at the best experimental materials, they are either decorated with polar groups like in the article~\cite{Li_2019} or they present open metal sites like in the article~\cite{Pei_2022}. However, we do not find these criteria as being essential when looking at the results of the current screenings. 

In this final chapter, I want to discuss three main research focuses: (i) the calculation of transport properties that could be further optimized, (ii) the adsorption calculations in flexible frameworks, and (iii) the better description of the polarization in the energy calculations.

\section{Screening flexible materials}

The reason why people usually prefer rigid frameworks is the high complexity brought by the simulation of the dynamics of a flexible framework. We already saw the cost of simulating a grand canonical ensemble using MC methods and developed strategies to avoid these type of calculations. The simulation of a flewible framework would require to relax the volume and simulate an osmotic ensemble ($\mu$,$P$,$T$), which requires MC moves on the volume of the unit cell itself.\autocite{Bousquet2012} This type of MC simulations describes more accurately every aspect of the flexibility be it the intrinsic flexibility due to thermal agitation or the adsorbate-induced flexibility. However, in a screening procedure, this type of simulation can be prohibitively long, it should however be used as an accurate method to confirm the properties of a few top materials. 

In order to incorporate flexibility effects in the screening procedure at a minimal computational cost, another approach is to use a set of rigid structures that reflects the structural diversity generated by the thermal agitation of the nanoporous material. A first study on the effect of this intrinsic flexibility on the Xe/Kr selectivity suggests that some materials could lose selectivity due to the less favorable pore size the structure vibrates.\autocite{Witman_2017} For instance, the authors explained the discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical Xe/Kr selectivity of KAXQIL\autocite{KAXQIL} by its intrinsic flexibility, which questions the performance ranking obtained by a rigid-framework screening. In this section, I will introduce in details the study of Witman et al.\autocite{Witman_2017} and I will especially focus on the case of KAXQIL presented by them. Then, I will present introduce another approach based on the structural diversity among similar deposited experimental structures. We can in fact count a dozen different structures with the same chemical nature as KAXQIL but with very different structural characteristics depending on the loaded adsorbate, which suggests an adsorbate-induced flexibility in addition to the intrinsic flexibility previously studied. 

\subsection{Snapshot method}

\subsubsection{Methodology}

To model the dynamics of the framework, Witman et al.\ use the UFF forcefield to describe the non-electrostatic framework bond potentials except for the metal bondings. For the bond dynamics around the metal, a harmonic equilibrium is fixed around the values extracted from the experimental structure. For this reason, this forcefield definition is refered to as the UFF-fix-metal (UFF-FM). In addition of the Lennard-Jones description, the point charge Coulomb interactions are described using the standard Ewald summation technique based on the charges calculated by the density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) method.\autocite{manz2010chemically} Using this forcefield, the authors carried out a systematic snapshot generation of the structures from the CoRE MOF 2014 database with pre-calculated DDEC charges. And these snapshots were used to determine flexible Xe and Kr Henry constant values as well as the infinite dilution Xe/Kr selectivity. The flexible selectivity were found to be lower for {95\%} of the materials with a rigid selectivity over $25$ (as shown on the Figure~\ref{fgr:underestimated_rigid}), which suggests an over-estimation of the top performing materials. Furthermore, the effect of flexibility is much more important for the smaller pore sizes, because of the intensity of the interactions at lower distance.

\end{figure}

If we now focus on the issue of flexibility in KAXQIL, the authors used several methods to evaluate its effect on the Xe and Kr Henry constants and the Xe/Kr selectivity. For instance, they used another description of the metal--ligand bond using a cationic dummy model (UFF-CDM) and an \emph{ab initio} MD simulation using the PBE DFT function,\autocite{Perdew_1996} with a Grimme's D3 van der Waals correctio\autocite{Grimme_2010} (PBE+D3). Each of these three methods are used to generate about $30$ snapshots that were eventually used to determine the flexible framework's adsorption properties for KAXQIL.

The authors found that the lower experimental selectivity value of $16$ compared to the UFF-determined one could be partially explained by a flexibility effect. The selectivity evaluated on a rigid SBMOF-1 structure using the standard UFF forcefield is way higher than the one obtained when considering snapshots of a vibrating structure. The \emph{ab initio} MD method that should be the closest to the actual dynamics does not recover the whole phenomenon because of the system size dependence. To actually see the crystallographic deformations, multiple unit cell replications are usually necessary. Moreover, the UFF forcefield used does not give a perfect picture of the interaction energies at play in the system neither. But an overall trend is, however, drawn in this study since it is possible to attribute the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical data to the rigidity hypothesis.

\end{table}

This approach does not give a complete picture of the flexibility effect on the selectivity value, but can rapidly identify a weakness in the rigidity hypothesis and therefore warn on a poossible over- or under-estimation of the selectivity, which can lead to identifying wrongfully a material as the best or missing the opportunity of finding a better material. The main advantage of this technique is the relative speed compared to an osmotic ensemble Monte Carlo simulation.\autocite{Bousquet2012} But the main drawback the main drawback is the imperfect description of the intrinsic flexibility as the only phenomenon at play. For instance, in the following, I will show some adsorbate-induced effects that were neglected but can be retrieved by using the multiple works on the same SBMOF-1 material. In this approach, we avoid the issues around MD simulations and we only base our reasoning on observed structural changes. 


\subsection{Experimental database approach}

According to original paper on SBMOF-1,\autocite{Banerjee_2016} the theoretical selectivity calculated by UFF is around $70.6$. However, the experimental selectivity is much lower, around $16$. To solve this mystery, Witman et al. used a snapshot-based method to evaluate the effect of selectivity. The intrinsic flexibility lowers the selectivity, which goes in the right direction to explain the difference of selectivity, but it does not seem to capture the whole picture. 

I think that the missing effect that could explain the discrepancies observed is the deformation induced by the loading of adsorbate inside the material. For instance, experimentally a structure is never empty when we resolve it by X-ray, and molecules are actually loaded inside. As shown on the Table~\ref{table:sbmof}, the structure that was originally published for its good \ce{CO2}/\ce{N2} selectivity\autocite{Yeh2012,Banerjee2012} was also tested for water adsorption, and two different structures emerged from this study: KAXQOR and KAXQIL. The first one is loaded by either air or \ce{CO2}, and the structure does not seem to be stretched as much (low LCD values around \SI{4.5}{\angstrom}). The second one, on the other hand is loaded by water that forms big clusters inside the pores and therefore stretches the pore size toward higher values (high LCD values around \SI{5.0}{\angstrom}). If we look at the structures resolved in the Nature Communications study\autocite{Banerjee_2016}, depending on the adsorbate (hexane, water, butane, krypton or xenon), the LCD and PLD values change in the first order according to the size of the adsorbate as illustrated on the Figure~\ref{fgr:stretch}. There are of course other effects, like the clustering we mentioned for water, but also less expected effects such as the orientation of the adsorbate inside the structure.

As shown on the Figure~\ref{fgr:ads_config}, the orientation of the hexane molecule inside the material seems to favor either a configuration with a large LCD and a low PLD (QUXRUY), or a slightly lower LCD with a slightly higher PLD (QUXRIM). The material configurations are, however, a bit different from the ones observed with KXQOR or KAXQIL.

\end{figure}

Now that I characterized the adsorbate effect on a few example-configurations, we can better understand the thought process that lead to the identification of KAXQIL as a candidate for Xe/Kr separation. The KAXQIL structure is actually representing the material loaded by water with large pores which enables a good interaction with a large molecule like xenon. For this reason, it was identified as a top selective material. However, when it was experimentally tested for low pressure adsorption using the Henry constant, it is most likely that the pores are not stretched, which implies lower Henry constants than expected. The structures UQEFAZ or KAXQOR seem to a better description of this low-pressure case since the experimental selectivity values are much more consistent with their theoretical selectivity values. 

To confirm this hypothesis, we would need to measure a high-loading Xe/Kr binary mixture adsorption uptake. If xenon is highly represented in the adsorbent material, then the structure would we much more favorable to the xenon adsorption, hence increasing the selectivity value closer to the theoretically predicted one. This also highlights a composition effect, if the initial mixture has a low xenon content, the structure would most likely have narrower pores, which could decrease the selectivity. By changing the composition of the binary mixture, this effect could also be measured experimentally, if the initial hypothesis on the adsorbate-induced flexibility is correct.

This method could be used on other materials by screening for materials with a similar chemical composition and topology, for example. However, due to the bias in research focus, it not always possible to find structures in very different adsoption conditions. To work around these limitations, one could either expertimentally generate these structures when a material seems interesting to see if the flexibility plays a role in the adsorption process. Or alternatively, one could computationally generate these structures by running structure optimizations on loaded structures. Either way, this new approach to flexibility seems complementary to the ones mentioned previously because it seems to have a similar (or slightly higher due to the adsorbate) computational cost as the Witman approach, while avoiding the computationally prohibitive calculation (in a screening) presented by Bousquet et al. 


\subsubsection{Diffusion in a flexible environment}

The transport can also be modulated by the adsorbate-induced flexibility of SBMOF-1. Depending on the structural configuration of the material, the diffusion coefficient is limiting only for some configurations of the material: it is equal to $3\times10^{-8}$~\si{\square\cm\per\s} for KAXQIL and $1\times10^{-11}$~\si{\square\cm\per\s} for UQEFED (Table~\ref{table:sbmof}). This lower diffusion coefficient can be simply explained by the change in PLD value induced by the stretching illustrated on the Figure~\ref{fgr:stretch}. For a material mostly loaded by krypton molecules, the diffusion coeffcient of xenon is much higher ($5\times10^{-6}$~\si{\square\cm\per\s}), although it not free diffusion, it can at least be considered as an unobstructed diffusion inside the material. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/6-perspectives/KAXQIL_stretch.pdf}
  \caption{ Visualization of the pore size stretching effect using the GrAED algorithm. The xenon increases the LCD value while diminishing the PLD value. }\label{fgr:stretch}
\end{figure}

Now that we identified two completely different diffusion behaviors, we can extrapolate these results to hypothetical conditions. For instance, if there is a relation between the quantity of xenon inside the pores and the structural similarity toward UQEFED, then the material could kinetically limit the adsorption of xenon at a high loading of xenon. In other words, it could be kinetically harder to adsorb xenon at higher xenon loadings. If we connect this conclusion to the one obtained on the adsroption process itself, the dsorption of xenon is also much more thermodynamically favorable at higher values of xenon loading. There seems to be a complexe thermodynamics-kinetics trade-off as we articulated in the previous chapter since KAXQIL and UQEFED are structurally quite similar, but it occurs at higher partial pressure in xenon. At an industrial point of view, the inclusion of transport effects in the analysis highlights additional cost in adsorbing xenon at high loading values, if this theoretical study is confirmed by experiments.

By using simple simulation methods (Widom insertion and MD) on rigid structures, I probed the effects of flexibility on both the adsorption and transport properties using experimentally resolved structures in different adsorption conditions. This study sheds light on the mystery around the experiment-theory discrepancies and opens up opportunities to understand similar problematic systems. In this study, I relied on the experimental data that was published on the SBMOF structure, the same resources are not always available for other systems and maybe an effort of data generation using either experiments or simulations should be performed in these cases. If generalized, this approach can even be automatically applied on a series of structures, opening up the possibility of ``flexibility-aware'' screenings in the future. Aware of the importance of both flexibility and transport effects, other studies have tried to incorporate both in a small-scale screening process.\autocite{Stanton_2022} The authors used a flexible forcefield MD simulations to determine the diffusion coefficient and DFT calculations at the adsorption site to asses the adsorption performance. The main issue of this method is its computational cost, but it can be an alternative solution to the one introduced here, when no prior knowledge are available on the structures flexibility. 

\section{Noble Gas Polarizability}

The last but not least effect that could influence greatly the adsorption performances prediction is, of course the level of theory behind the interaction energy modelization. In most screening studies, we use (me included) very low-level classical theories to describe the guest--host interactions, because of the low computational cost associated to it. To improve the description, some studies focus on a few specific structures and use higher levels of theory such as DFT calculations. However, the prohibitive computational cost of these methods make it hard to deploy it in high-throughput screenings. 

But first, we should identify the limits of molecular modeling in the current screening methodologies before exploring higher cost methods. This work is actually motivated by the recent advances in experimental design of nanoporous materials for Xe/Kr separation. The most selective materials are based on highly polar groups or exposed open-metal sites.\autocite{Li_2019,Pei_2022} The polarization is, therefore, central in these materials, but it is not well described by a simple Lennard-Jones potential especially when it is induced by high partial charge values (open-metal site or polar groups). 

For this reason, it is necessary to develop a polarizable forcefield that include the effect of the surrounding partial charges into the guest--host interactions. The difference of polarizability between xenon and krypton could let new materials emerge. The best material ranking obtained by this type of screening would be completely different from the standard one. In this section, I will introduce the problem of current methodologies through an experiment-theory comparison, and then I will introduce possible methodologies that could be used to take into account the polarization in the currently ued Lennard-Jones potentials.

\subsection{Problem definition}

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{ Comparison between the selectivity values obtained experimentally and computationally. The structures are split in three categories depending on the difference between experiments and theory. We can explain the case of SBMOF-1 by its flexibility. The discreapncies for the materials in the lower right correspond to the ones introduced by Li et al. and Pei et al.,\autocite{Li_2019,Pei_2022} and the difference can be explained by the polarization that is not included in the level of theory considered. \todo{higher resolution+change xaxis (IAST)} }\label{fgr:exp_theory_discrepancy}
\end{figure}

If we consider the selectivity of good materials for xenon/krypton separation that are often presented in the literature, the materials named \ce{Co3(HCOO)6},\autocite{Wang_2014} CC3,\autocite{Chen_2014} SBMOF-2,\autocite{Chen_2015} CROFOUR-1-Ni,\autocite{Mohamed_2016}  SBMOF-1,\autocite{Banerjee_2016} \ce{Co3(C4O4)2(OH)2}\autocite{Li_2019} and ZJU-17a\autocite{Pei_2022} often appear as top separation materials.
When comparing their selectivity values obtained by a Widom insertion with the UFF forcefield to the experimental values as shown on the Figure~\ref{fgr:exp_theory_discrepancy}, there is generally a good correlation, however, in some cases like SBMOF-1, other effects could explain the difference observed (see thr previous section on flexibility). In other cases, it is the polarization effect that was not taken into account and could in fact explain the difference. To better understand this phenomenon, I will describe the two papers that found record-breaking Xe/Kr selectivity values based on polar hydroxyl groups and open metal sites.

The first paper of Li et al.\autocite{Li_2019} published in 2019 introduced a squarate-based MOF with a Xe/Kr selectivity of $69.7$ for a 20:80 binary mixture estimated by the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)\autocite{Cessford_2012}. The authors explained this outstanding xenon affinity by two factors: a pore size close to the kinetic diameter of a xenon and the stabilization effect of the hydroxyl group. DFT calculations determined binding energies of the order of \SI{44.1}{\kJ\per\mole} for xenon and \SI{33.7}{\kJ\per\mole}, which suggests a separation process of enthalpic nature (usually the case for highly selective materials). Because of the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom, the hydroxyl group interacts strongly with the xenon through a permanent dipole--induced dipole interaction (introduced in the section~\ref{sct:interaction}). On the other hand, the pore wall creates unidimensional channels that present adsorption pores with a \SI{4.1}{\angstrom}$\times$\SI{4.3}{\angstrom} size, which is very close to the xenon kinetic diameter of about \SI{4.0}{\angstrom}. Finally if we look at the breakthrough experiment data, we observe a rather slow release of xenon in the mass transfer zone, which suggests a rather low xenon diffusion coefficient in this material.\todo{maybe compare to SBMOF-1 breakthrough curve}
