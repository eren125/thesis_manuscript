\todo{Gas separation of xenon/krypton}

Industrial gas separation processes is widely used to supply purified reactants and inert gases for the chemical, the health, the agricultural and the food industries. It can also be used to mitigate negative environmental impact of some industrial activities: in concrete or steel production factories, the highly problematic \ce{CO2} emissions could be separated from other atmospheric gases and captured; in nuclear treatment plants, volatile radioactive compounds (e.g., $^{85}$Kr) can also be captured through an effective separation. Different small molecules are usually considered in these processes such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide, noble gases, hydrogen, methane, or nitrous oxide. The xenon/krypton separation is usually performed on atmospheric gases,\autocite{kerry2007industrial} but other more abundant sources of noble gases can be found especially in the nuclear industry.\autocite{Banerjee_2014}

Gas separation and purification are essential processes since they provide key reactants and inert gases for the chemical industry, as well as medical or food grade gases. Among them, we can find easily extractable or synthesizable molecules such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, noble gases, hydrogen, methane, or nitrous oxide. Moreover, gas separation is crucial in mitigating negative environmental impact at the end of industrial processes, such as facilities emitting green house gases (\emph{e.g.} concrete or steel plants) or treating volatile radioactive wastes like \ex{85}Kr. Cryogenic liquefaction or distillation is currently the mainstream technique to achieve industrial gas separation, while adsorbent beds made of nanoporous materials (activated alumina or zeolites) are mostly used as a less energy-intensive pre-purification system.\autocite{kerry2007industrial}

A wider use of nanoporous materials could reduce the energy consumption of current separation processes since adsorption is way less energy intensive than liquefaction.\autocite{national2019research} For instance, some prototypes involving beds of nanoporous materials have been developed for xenon/krypton separation to avoid employing cryogenic distillation.\autocite{Banerjee2018} For the process to be viable, materials need to perform even better and many studies focus on synthesizing ever more selective materials by leveraging all chemical intuitions around noble gas adsorption properties.\autocite{Chen_2014, Li_2019, Pei_2022} In order to speed the discovery process of novel materials with key properties, computational screening can identify factors explaining the performance and pre-select candidates for further experimental studies. As recently conceptualized by Lyu et al., a synergistic workflow combining computational discovery and experimental validation can push material discovery to the next stage.\autocite{Lyu_2020, Jablonka_2022} But to efficiently guide experimental discoveries, computational chemists are facing two major challenges: generating reliably more structures and evaluating them with fast and accurate models.

The number of nanoporous materials is potentially unlimited; for the metal--organic frameworks (MOFs) alone, over 90,000 structures have been synthesized~\autocite{Groom_2016} and 500,000 computationally constructed~\autocite{Wilmer_2012,Boyd_2016,Colon_2017}. To deal with this ever-increasing amount of structures, we need to design more efficient screening procedures as well as faster performance evaluation tools. To go beyond the time-consuming calculations over the whole dataset, computational chemists developed funnel-like screening procedures to reduce the need for expensive simulations and introduced machine learning (ML) models to replace them with faster evaluation tools.\autocite{Ren_2022} To further improve the selectivity screening for Xe/Kr separation, we will need to design better performing structural and energy-based descriptors.
