\chapter*{General conclusions}

In this thesis, I explored different approaches to find the best nanoporous materials for adsorption-based industrial xenon/krypton separation (e.g., pressure-swing adsorption). As highlighted in our literature review, a high-throughput screening focus on one specific property of the nanoporous material in order to find the best material for a targeted application. There are three main challenges for screenings: (i) the accuracy of the methods used to characterize the key properties at play, (ii) the experimental/computation time required to determine those properties, and (iii) the
